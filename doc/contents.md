# STRTprep

STRTprep (https://github.com/shka/STRTprep) is an open-source software package for preprocess and analysis of STRT RNA-seq data. The first version was for the preprocessing and quality-check purposes, then the version 2 realized automated statistical tests of the differential expression, and finally the version 3 performs "transcription start region" based high resolution analysis including long noncoding RNAs and novel genes/transcripts. This package can run on both Linux and OSX.

Edit two files to describe your experiment and study design, and run the pipeline as below, then you can finish from preprocess of raw reads until differential expression tests. Enjoy more further downstream analysis!

```bash
git clone -b v3dev https://github.com/shka/STRTprep.git STRTprep3.test
cd STRTprep3.test

# edit src/conf.yaml & src/samples.csv
rake -m -j `gnproc` qc > qc.log 2>&1
